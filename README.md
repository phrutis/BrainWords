### Frequently asked questions ‚ùì

**I indicated a nickname and am looking for how the admins will pay me?**
<br><br>
If you decide to search with a nickname, write in telegram phrutis your nickname and an empty BTC address.
Your BTC address will be entered into a private table for the payment of the find or % of the pool.
The find can be found at night when you are offline, so as not to wait for you and search for it, the admins will have your address.
<hr>

**What is a BRAINWALLET**
<br><br>
These are passwords or phrases converted to sha256; the output is a private key to the address.<br>
People stored coins at the address and a passphrase in their heads.<br>
This method was used 10-15 years ago. At that time, coins were worth almost nothing.<br>
Passwords were lost and forgotten. Do you remember your password 12 years ago? Are you sure?<br>
One character, dot or register is wrong and the entire wallet is lost. There is no restore button.<br>

**What does Brainwallet look like?**
<br><br>
Here is a white list of passwords, phrases, balances, study<br>
https://privatekeyfinder.io/brainwallet/bitcoin/
<hr>

**I connected for the first time. The program has frozen, 15 minutes have passed**
<br><br>
When a client first connects, a database of BTC addresses is downloaded<br>
This usually lasts from 3 to 10 minutes<br>
It depends on the Internet speed. Can take up to 20 minutes.<br>
<hr>

**I connected for the first time. The program froze at this point, 20 minutes have passed**
<br>
**Generating the EC point cache. This is only done once...***
<br><br>
At the first start, an acceleration table is generated.<br>
This usually lasts from 5 to 12 minutes<br>
If you have a lot of cards and a weak processor it may take longer.<br>
Wait for the table generation to complete.<br>
Upon completion of generation, the table will be saved to the file ecmult_big-123456788-24.bin 1-6 GB. (don't delete it)<br>
When restarted, the table will not be generated, the client will start immediately.<br>
<hr>

**I connected for the first time. The program froze, 25 minutes have passed???**
<br>
I wrote: loaded addresses: 28380176 and froze!<br>
**NO SPEED!**
<br><br>
Close the window.<br>
Open and run the client again:<br>
./bb -u YourNickName<br>
bb.exe -u YourNickName<br>
The client will start working and you will see the speed<br>
<hr>

**My speed in the table is 2 times higher**
<br><br>
This happens when you reconnect. This speed does not affect anything.<br>
% of the pool is calculated by the number of completed combinations (total)<br>
Usually after some time the site begins to show your nominal speed.
<hr>

**Have you already found any finds in Brians?**
<br><br>
Yes there were, 20-30 finds from $0.40 to $1270.<br>
<hr>

**I found where is my payment? 2-3 hours have already passed!**
<br><br>
You need to consider time zones and other factors<br>
The payment will be made after all calculations, divided by hunters in one transaction.
<hr>

**I can‚Äôt launch the program, error..**
<br><br>
Download the newest (latest) drivers for your video card.<br>
If the problem is not resolved, write about it in the chat.<br>
There are no telepaths in the group, take a screenshot of the program window with the error.
<hr>

**How to take a screenshot?**
<br><br>
Windows Press Ctrl + PrtSc, open Point Ctrl + v crop and send to group.
<hr>

**How do I know what I found? passphrase, balance?**
<br><br>
When someone finds someone in a telegram group, the bot **BrainBot2** sends notifications:<br>

```
USER: Vasya
-================= FOUND ==================-
Adr: 1M3WQxqkktCX23JszuzVknci75HvJ2N2Vm
===========================================
```

If the user specified an address instead of a nickname, the following message will be sent:<br>
```
USER: 1GDQhEzKpsJwanyeaP1bSvX7uodmuYSKa9
-================= FOUND ==================-
Adr: 1M3WQxqkktCX23JszuzVknci75HvJ2N2Vm
===========================================
```
Vasya user needs to look at his client window.<br>
In the client window, he will also see the found BTC address.<br>
Example of a find in the client:<br>
![creenshk](https://github.com/phrutis/BrainWords/assets/140947743/1f0eebf8-3e19-45aa-8938-b788b30bfe72)
You can check the balance of the found address here https://www.blockchain.com/ru/ or in any other blockchain.<br>
This way you can find out the balance of the find, the finder is entitled to 50%<br>
Admins also receive a message from the bot with a find. They know who found the key and other information.<br>
If the amount is more than $100, a screenshot of statistics is taken to record the % of the pool of all participants at the time of discovery.<br>
After all calculations, payment is made.<br>
After payment, the admins will post the found password and private key in the chat.
<hr>

**How are finds paid up to $100?**
<br><br>
If you search by nickname, the admins will send you the find by private message in telegram.<br><br>
If you are searching anonymously (BTC address instead of nickname) <br>
The balance of the find will be sent to your BTC address (minus the transaction fee.)
<hr>

**I rent cards from miners question:**
<br>
How can I protect myself so that they don‚Äôt get my find (% of the pool)?
<br><br>
When you rent rigs (cards) from miners, ask them to indicate your BTC address instead of your nickname.<br>
In this case, the payment will go to the address indicated in the nickname<br>
<hr>

**I'm a miner, I don't want to be visible in the chat, etc. How can I participate anonymously?**
<br><br>
Launch the client, enter your empty BTC address instead of your nickname.<br>
If you have any questions, write only to the admins personally.
<hr>

**How do I calculate my % of the pool?**
<br>
How is the find divided?
<br><br>
Here is a clear example of the distribution of a find:<br>
Vasya2024 found the address $150000<br>
A screenshot of the statistics is taken and sent to the chat to record % of the pool.<br>
Vaya2024 receives $75,000 (50%)<br>
Admins receive $45,000 (30%)<br>
20% of the pool is $30,000 (100%)<br>
For example, your % in the statistics table is 4.739%<br>
(% is calculated based on the number of completed combinations (total)<br>
You will receive $1421, which will cover part of your electricity and other expenses<br>
The winner of Vasya2024 **NOT** receives % of the pool! Its % of the pool goes to pay commissions for payout transactions.<br>
If after all payments he has coins left, they will again be divided among the hunters.
<hr>

**How to specify specific cards?**
<br><br>
Add -d 0,5,6,7<br> to the run line
The list of cards starts from 0.<br>
Specify the cards you need separated by commas
<hr>

**After an hour my speed drops, the client falls off...** <br>
**No physical ability to restart the client**
<br><br>
**Option 1** <br>
For those whose speed drops after an hour or two.<br>
The client falls off the pool, there is no time to go to the location to restart.<br>
Install the remote access program **AnyDesk** (win, lin, ubuntu) into your PC (rig)<br>
Download the AnyDesk application to your phone. It will take 5 seconds for the client to restart.<br>

**Option 2** <br>
**start the client using the batch file**<br>

**For Ubuntu**<br>
```wget https://github.com/phrutis/BrainWords/releases/download/v4.0/rig_online.sh```<br>
Open the file with a text editor, replace Your_Nick_Hire with your nickname or BTC address!<br>
```chmod +x rig_online.sh```<br>
Launching a pool via a body file<br>
```./rig_online.sh```<br>

The essence of the batch file: If the used memory in the gpu card is less than 2 GB<br>
There was probably some kind of server or internet failure or error, the client stopped.<br>
Every 20 minutes there is a check, if the client falls off, it will be restarted automatically. <br>

**For Windows**<br>
https://github.com/phrutis/BrainWords/releases/download/v4.0/START_POOL.bat
<br>(is the defender swearing? - this is his normal reaction to all .bat files)

Open START_POOL.bat in a text editor. Replace Your_Nick_Hire with your nickname or BTC address <br>
The default value is 7200 seconds (2 hours) until the next program restart.<br>
You can set another value 3600 (hour) or 14400 (4 hours)<br>
Do not set the value too low (less than an hour)<br>
Save the batch file. <br>
Place the file next to the program bb.exe (bb)<br>
Zarusk pool ```START_POOL.bat```<br>
2 windows should open.<br>
In the first window there is a timer (time until reboot), in the second window there is a pool client.<br>
After the reboot, the client window opens minimized, look at the bottom of the screen, it can be expanded.<br>
